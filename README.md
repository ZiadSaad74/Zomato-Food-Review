# Food-Review
- This is my data analysis for reviews of fine foods from amazon. 
The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories.

- After analysis I trained a classifcation model to predict whether if the review is positive or negative, the images attached in the reop shows the output. It has 84.16% accuracy 

- Used tools: python, sklearn, seaborn , nltk, streamlit and numpy
